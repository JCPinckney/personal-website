abstract: "This report examines the dynamics of civic mobilization in political transitions initiated through major nonviolent action campaigns, with a particular focus on forms of mobilization that promote democracy and prevent breakdowns into violence. It is based on data in the Civic Mobilization in Civil Resistance transitions (CM-CRt) dataset on 72 political transitions that occurred between 1945 and 2019. Analysis of the data uncovers several patterns that correlate with outbreaks of violence and democratic breakdown. In particular, concentrated, confrontational tactics such as public demonstrations and sit-ins tend to be followed by violent outbreaks, particularly when they experience government repression."
