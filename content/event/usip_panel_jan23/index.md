summary: A panel discussion on civil mobilization in civil resistance transitions, focusing on Armenia and Tunisia.
abstract: 'In recent years, nonviolent campaigns for democracy have won major victories against violent autocracies across the globe. But after those initial victories are won, peaceful activists face a deceptively difficult question: What happens next? Transitional periods come with their own series of challenges, including drop-offs in popular mobilization, opposition fragmentation, political violence and elite-led counterrevolutions. These challenges are by no means insurmountable â€” but if left unaddressed, they can undermine progress and ultimately reverse promising transitions to democracy.'
