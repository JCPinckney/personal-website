I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Political Science in the [School of Economic, Political, and Policy Sciences](https://epps.utdallas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Before coming to UT Dallas in Fall 2023, I worked as the Director of Applied Research for [The Horizons Project](https://www.horizonsproject.us), where I led research efforts focused on countering democratic backsliding through restorative movement building tactics and approaches. I have also worked as the senior researcher with the Program on Nonviolent Action at the [United States Institute of Peace](https://www.usip.org/), a post-doctoral research fellow in the department of Sociology and Political Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, an external associate at the Peace Research Institution of Oslo (PRIO), and a research fellow at the Sie Cheou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy, where I supervised data collection for the Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD) and the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) 3.0 data project. 

My research on civil resistance, democratization, and peacebuilding has been widely published by major university presses and leading journals including *Comparative Political Studies, International Studies Quarterly, Journal of Peace Research, Journal of Conflict Resolution,* and *Conflict Management and Peace Science.* My first book [From Dissent to Democracy: The Promise and Peril of Civil Resistance Transitions](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/from-dissent-to-democracy-9780190097318?lang=en&cc=us), was published in 2020 by Oxford University Press.

I received my PhD in International Relations from the University of Denver in March 2018, my MA also from the University of Denver in 2014, and my BA in International Affairs from Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts in 2008. I was a 2012 recipient of the Korbel School’s Sie Fellowship and a 2016 recipient of the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict’s PhD fellowship. Prior to entering graduate school I worked for study abroad programs in Egypt and India and helped found BIRDS International, an NGO addressing rural poverty issues in South India. I currently live in Washington, DC, and will be moving to Plano, Texas in July 2023. In my free time, I enjoy running, mountain climbing, and [watching great films](https://letterboxd.com/jcpinckney/).
