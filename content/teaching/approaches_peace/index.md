This course offers an introductory survey of the various approaches to peace. It begins by looking at the problem of violence and war from a variety of perspectives. The two main sections of the course are then organized according to the major distinction between "negative peace" (the absence of war or violence - conflict management) and "positive peace" (justice, dispute resolution, reconciliation - conflict resolution). Mechanisms to achieve both kinds of peace are explored, with special attention to their underlying assumptions about human behavior and their limitations. Although the focus is primarily directed to the international level, applications to the national and local levels are occasionally referenced as well.

I will be teaching this course for the first time in Fall of 2023 at UT Dallas, and will update this page with additional information as the course develops.
